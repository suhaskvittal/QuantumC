WORST CASE FOR QUBIT REPR:
	1 qubit: 128 bits ( COMPLEX64, COMPLEX64 )
	2 qubit: 256 bits ( COMPLEX64, COMPLEX64, ...)
	...
	n qubit: 2^(n+6)

OPTIMIZATION - Discretize angles (with M possible angles, call it a qubit-M)
	Suppose M = 16. Then there are 16 angles, starting from 0 with step pi/8.
	1 qubit16: 72 bits (FLOAT32, FLOAT32, CHAR)
	2 qubit16: 144 = 112 bits (FLOAT32, FLOAT32, FLOAT32, FLOAT32, CHAR, CHAR)
	...
	n qubit16: 2^(n+5) + 2^(n+2) = 9*2^(n+2)

With 1KiB = 1024 bytes = 8192 bits of space, this would mean the maximum number of entangled qubit16 we could have is 7 entangled states, with 3584 bits remaining.

We can further cut down on size by using half-precision floats (we only need -1 to 1):
	1 qubit16: 40 bits (FLOAT16, FLOAT16, CHAR)
	2 qubit16: 80 bits (FLOAT16, FLOAT16, FLOAT16, FLOAT16, CHAR, CHAR)
	...
	n qubit16: 2^(n+4) + 2^(n+2) = 5*2^(n+2)
Or quarter-precision floats:
	1 qubit16: 24 bits (FLOAT8, FLOAT8, CHAR)
	2 qubit16: 48 bits (FLOAT8, FLOAT8, FLOAT8, FLOAT8, CHAR, CHAR)
	...
	n qubit16: 2^(n+3) + 2^(n+2) = 3*2^(n+2) 
Which would yield
	half-precision: 8 entangled qubits with 3072 bits remaining.
	qtr-precision:	9 entangled cubits with 2048 bits remaining.
Define the following types:
	qubit16_32:	16 angled qubit with single-precision.	72b	9*2^(n+2)
	qubit16_16:	16 angled qubit with half-precision.	40b	5*2^(n+2)
	qubit16_8:	16 angled qubit with quarter-precision.	24b	3*2^(n+2)



OPTIMIZATION - Discretize the magnitude. 
We can partition the interval [0, 1] in to 2^k subsections. 
Say k=8; we can represent 128 values in [0, 1] within a byte.
	0xA0 is 1, 0x00 is 0. 
	Operations is like FPP operations, but only with a mantissa.
	We get the quarter-precision bit equation: B = 3*2^(n+2).

Clearly, the biggest issue is dealing with entangled qubits. How can we compress the information?
	For n entangled qubits, the k-th state needs 12 bits of representation.
	Argument: We represent each entangled set of states sparsely.
		Suppose the compressed n-level qubit has k <= 2^n non-zero states. 
		Then, we can just represent the qubit with k states by enumerating the nonzero states.
		We have k n bit numbers that represent the nonzero states.
		The size is thus nk + 12k = (n+12)k.
	Argument: Multiple states can have the same value, as there are only
		2^12 possible values a state can attain.
		Enumerate only distinct values.

Update: Qubit is now 32 bits (16 bits per state) due to errors with RT(NOT) gate.
	So size is 2^(n+4) where n is number of entangled qubits.

Qubit is now 48 bits (24 bits per state) due to errors with RT(SWAP) gate.
	So size is 24 * 2^(n) = 3*2^(n+3)
